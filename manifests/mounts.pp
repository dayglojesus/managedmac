# == Class: managedmac::mounts
#
# Uses Mobileconfig type to define drives to map at login time.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*urls*]
#   A list of network mount URIs you wish to open at login. OS X Finder will
#   open these URIs in sequence. You can use afp, smb/cifs or http(s) type URLs.
#   Type: Array
#   Default: empty
#
# === Variables
#
# Not applicable
#
# === Examples
# This class was designed to be used with Hiera. As such, the best way to pass
# options is to specify them in your Hiera datadir:
#
#  # Example: defaults.yaml
#  ---
#  managedmac::mounts::urls:
#    - 'https://some.dav.com/web/personal/%short_name%'
#    - 'smb://some.windows.com/%short_name%'
#
# Then simply, create a manifest and include the class...
#
#  # Example: my_manifest.pp
#  include managedmac::mounts
#
# If you just wish to test the functionality of this class, you could also do
# something along these lines:
#
#  # Create an URLs Array
#  $urls = ['afp://some.server.com/some/volume']
#
#  class { 'managedmac::mounts':
#    urls => $urls,
#  }
